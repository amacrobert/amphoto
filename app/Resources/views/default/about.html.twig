            <p>I am a Boston-based photographer. I picked up photography in October of 2014 and soon after began shooting nightclubs. Since, I've evolved into photographing concerts, models, editorials, weddings, and festivals. I specialize in nightlife and capturing incredible moments wherever there is a party.</p>
            <p>I'm local to Boston, but available for bookings worldwide.</p>
